  (1, 'Redwood Camp', 'Redwood Camp offers privacy and serenity in and around our spectacular redwood groves alongside Salmon Creek, home of collaborative efforts to restore native Coho Salmon to the area. There is direct access to the creek as well as miles of trails meandering through quiet woods and meadows in the tranquility of our private forest. The campsites are set along the edge of a meadow beside the creek, and are sheltered from coastal winds, offering soul-restoring solitude and quiet. Redwood #1, situated within a towering stand of redwoods, can accommodate larger groups. Site #2 is set right by the creek and backed into a stand of redwoods. Each spot is limited to 8 people including children. Four campers are included in the listed price, with an additional fee of $15 per additional person per night. Each campsite includes a picnic table, fire ring (with grill) and access to a port-a-potty. Bring your own potable water and be prepared to take away your trash. Well-behaved pets are welcome, although please keep them away from our working dogs that are guarding livestock within our pastures. This private camp offers direct access to the many miles of hiking trails on the ranch. By heading uphill through the redwood, fir and bay laurel forest to the open uplands, you will be able to view the hundreds of acres of natural pasture lands of the ranch (with our ducks, goats and Scottish Highland cattle) and a view of the sea. Sunsets can be spectacular. Returning downhill, you will end up at the creek and your own camp. If you prefer a less strenuous trek, try the path that meanders for miles alongside the creek, through more meadows and into an enchanted canyon. Four Wheel Drive tours of the ranch and forest are available by arrangement at an additional cost, enabling visitors to see the most scenic, remote and hilly areas of the property. You can have all this without sacrificing easy access to some of Sonoma County's most famous attractions. Whether it's sandy beaches, award-winning clam chowder, a wine tour or a hot air balloon ride you're after, you won't have far to drive if you make our ranch your base camp. You may see a family of deer appear suddenly, or a few Scottish Highland cows which we allow to roam freely over the property. There are over twenty species of wild birds that grace this protected spot, so bring your binoculars! If you want a private creek side camp, complete with redwoods, that is a hundred times more quiet and secluded than any public or Forest Service campground, check us out!', 8, 'NOTE regarding summer bookings: During Red Fire Alerts or times when dry conditions make fires dangerous, we will ban campfires at our sites. Propane stoves are OK for cooking, but not as a heat source. NOTE REGARDING ACCESS: 4WD or AWD WITH GOOD GROUND CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED due to steep, rutted farm road with loose gravel in
